Paper Title: Discrete Tree-seed Algorithm for Solving Symmetric Travelling Salesman Problem
Paper Author: Felix Beese, Jens Lohmann

A. Summary of the paper:
Design and comparision of a Dicrete Tree-Seed Algorithm and a Genetic Algorithm to approximate the Symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem. Evaluation on tree datasets of different size. The DTSA was found to have a shorter runtime but on average worse final solutions.

B. Strengths of the paper:
- Very good evaluation
- Good introduction to (S)-TSP
- Good and interesting figures (sometimes maybe a little small)

C. Weaknesses of the paper:
- Pseudo code being hard to read (lines not enumerated, too much whitespace between lines)
- Missing Conclusion

D. Short evaluations

D1. Coverage of the Field:
- The paper sticks closely to its topic
- Maybe mention other use cases for genetic algorithms etc.

D2. Depth of the topic:
- Good. Ideas on inner workings of the two approaches were described in detail

D3. Structure:
- table of contents might not be necessary for a rather short paper
- Chapter 1 should be split in an Introduction and a Related Work chapter
- Conclusion is missing / mixed with Discussion
- The number of subchapters could maybe be slightly reduced

D4. Quality of presentation / Clarity:
- algorithms should not be written in an itemize environment (try lstlisting)
- "dataset" might not be the correct name for the three "problem instances"
- axis description in figure 2 missing (also maybe use different unit to get rid of some zeros)

D5. Quality of the language:
- Generally good
- Some missing words (like in 1.1: "amount <of> time")
- 4.1 first line "findes"
- chapter 4.3 incorrect apostrophe

D6. Critical elaboration of the topic:
- Good. A little more details in 4.3 might be helpful (explanation of figure 4)

E. Detailed comments to the author:
- 1.2 "nearest neighbour tour" should be defined in the text
- more details on the "2-opt algorithm" needed
- 4.1: Would running the algorithms for more iterations achieve the same result as running it multiple times? This could be examined as part of the evaluation
- Orange boxes on page 10 seem out of place
- try to find some more references
- Maybe give some potential use cases of TSP in the introduction as motivation
